    "# The PKI Secret Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The public key infrastructure (PKI) secrets engine in Vault enables you to issue certificates directly via the API.

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases for the PKI secret engine are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integration with other tooling in order to have certificates manages centrally (e.g. management for self-signed certificates of service meshes).\n",

    "### Certificate Authorities\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now two ways to handle the certificate authority. Either we have a certificate authority that is fully managed by Vault, or we use Vault to issue trusted certificates by an external authority. Generally, having a fully managed authority has the advantage that the root certificate is fully contained within Vault and is close to impossible to leak. The problem is that we need to configure applications to then trust this root certificate. The advantage of using an external authority is that this is typically already trusted. Therefore applications will automatically trust the certificates issued by Vault.\n",

See [the official API documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/pki#generate-root) for more details. Essentially, using the endpoint, we will generate a self-signed CA of type `internal`, meaning that the key is kept internal to Vault and will never be displayed.

    "\n",
    "Let us simulate a root roation. In such a case a new root CA needs to be used because the old root is expiring. There are several approaches to perform this while allowing clients to update their trust within a defined time window. We will choose an approach where this is done by cross-signing an intermediate CA by both root CAs, such that they are both valid at the same time. This allows clients to update their trust into the new CA until the old one expires.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new self-signed root CA that will be our new root CA.\n",
    "2. Use the `cross-sign` API endpoint on the intermediate to generate a CSR for the new root CA (see https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/pki#generate-intermediate-csr, you will need the `key_ref` field with the default issuer).\n",
    "3. Sign the CSR with the new root CA.\n",
    "4. Import the certificate into the intemediate using the `set-signed` API endpoint.\n",
    "5. Issue a certificate with that issuer and validate its trust chain.\n",
    "6. Optionally, update the trust chains on both issuers of the intermediate to use both roots (by patching the issuer configuations with a `manual_chain`).\n",
