    "# Dynamic Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "Static secrets are quite a risk for an organisation, as they tend to not change over time. This makes them more prone to attacks such as brute forcing, and increases the impact of a credential leak. There are several approaches to avoid using static credentials for systems. The most common approach is to integrate all systems with some form of identity provider, and use a native identity managed by that provider to authenticate to any system. That way one only has to worry about the leak of the credential proving the identity. This credential is then typically rotated relatively often to provide security. While this approach is great for human to machine connections, it has several drawbacks, which can be solved in a nicer way for machine to machine accesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, in case of a leak, the identity credential can access all systems that it has permission to. Moreover, in many cases this solution cannot be used accross the entirety of the system landscape, because some systems might not support integrating with an identity provider, or they have no access to it due to network segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "HashiCorp Vault provides a different approach. Essentially, an identity credential is still used, but instead of using this to authenticate to the systems directly, it is used to authenticate to Vault, and then request a dynamic credential for the target system. Vault then generates a unique credential for the target system and provides it to the client. This credential can then be used for a bounded period of time, before the client needs to request another credential. This has a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The credentials to the target systems are short-lived, reducing the impact of a leak.\n",
    "- While the identity credential of the client still technically has access to all the systems it has permission to through the Vault, this accesses are controlled centrally within the Vault and logged there. Thus in case of an identity credential leak, remediation and analysis is much simpler.\n",
    "- The target systems do not require any kind of integeration. Vault takes care of that integration, and supports a wide range of systems by default. Additional systems can easily be supported by integrating plugins into Vault.\n",
    "- In case of network segmentation, different Vaults can be used. As the several Vaults can manage different systems, there is no issue regarding deploying several Vaults, as opposed to deploying several IdPs which need to be kept in sync or provide different sets of identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we will use PostgreSQL as a target system on which we will generate dynamic credentials. Thus we will want Vault to generate PSQL users on the fly for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start a Vault server. This will run Vault in the background and push the logs to `/tmp/vault.log`. If at any point in time the Vault crashes, this command will need to be used again to re-launch the Vault server."
