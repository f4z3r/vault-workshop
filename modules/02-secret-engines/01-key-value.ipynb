    "# The Key-Value Secret Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most commonly used secret engine in HashiCorp Vault. It enables the storage of arbitrary static blobs of data. It can thus be seen as a sort of password manager, except that it can be accessed and managed fully programatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases for the KV (Key-Value) secret engine are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Centralized password manager for a team. This is especially interesting if the team already has Vault in place and wants to take advantages of operational synergies (backups, versioning, etc).\n",
    "- Distribution of secrets for systems that are not integrated into Vault, nor with an IdP. For instance you might have an external system that does not support an integration with Vault or your standard identity provider. You will thus not use any form of dynamic credential system, but instead store the credential in a Vault KV engine. From there, the credential can be distributed to the application that requires it at runtime via the wide range of integrations supported by Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start a Vault server. This will run Vault in the background and push the logs to `/tmp/vault.log`. If at any point in time the Vault crashes, this command will need to be used again to re-launch the Vault server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, do not worry about the configuration with which we are starting the server. This will be covered in a separate module."

    "### Enabling the KV Secrets Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all operations with Vault, enabling the KV secrets engine is done via the API. The CLI can be used to avoid having to call the API directly and provides a nicer way to interact with the API. Some operations, enabling secrets engines included, can also be performed over the web UI. **This is not the case for all operations**. Enabling a secrets engine via the CLI is extremely simple:\n",

    "vault secrets enable -path=/my-secret-store/ -version=2 kv\n",

    "Let us instead do this via the UI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8200` in your browser.\n",
    "2. Login using `root-token` as the token.\n",
    "3. Click on \"Secrets Engines\" and then \"Enable new engine +\":\n",
    "   ![](./assets/img/enable-secrets-engine.png)\n",
    "4. Choose \"KV\".\n",
    "5. Enter the path under which we want to publish the engine as \"my-secret-store\" and create the engine. You can also have a look at the advanced configuration. The version 2 is the default, hence why we do not provide it here explicitly:\n",
    "   ![](./assets/img/kv-creation-screen.png)\n",
