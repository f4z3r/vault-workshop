    "# Log Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Vault offers two types of logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- server logs\n",
    "- audit logs\n",
    "\n",
    "Server logs provide information on the software operation of Vault. This includes information such as leader elections, and other operational insights into what Vault is doing internally. The audit logs on the other hand provide logs on every request and response made to Vault. These are critical to understand the usage of Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "Server logs are configured statically in the Vault configuration and offers quite [a few options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration#log_level) including the rotation of log files. We will not look at this in depth, as there is little operational tasks that are Vault specific here. Typically these logs are written to file and ideally pushed/pulled to a log aggregation system such as Splunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audit Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "Audit logs are configured via [the API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/system/audit) and support various audit deviced. **Audit logs are not enabled by default** and should thus be configured early on. Vault supports various audit devices such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- file (including stdout)\n",
    "- syslog\n",
    "- socket\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, the best option is probably to use a socket device where a log forwarding daemon listens and forwards them to a central instance. A great article on the pros and cons of how to configure audit logging can be found [on the HashiCorp blog](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/vault-logging-and-alerting-on-day-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will enable audit logging and then try to analyse these logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start a Vault server. This will run Vault in the background and push the logs to `/tmp/vault.log`. If at any point in time the Vault crashes, this command will need to be used again to re-launch the Vault server."

This is opposed to `\"response\"` logs where Vault logs what it replied. Of course, the audit log contains a timestamp. In the case of requests, it contains information on what endpoint was called with what operation (in this case the `sys/audit/test` endpoint with an `update` - `PUT` operation).

    "### Analysing Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see, `\"response\"` type audit logs typically contain much more information. They typically contain a request part in order to link the response to the request that triggered the response. In this case, one can see that the response is **not** for the test call we saw in the first line of the log, but rather from the actual call creating the audit device (as seen by the `request.path` value that is `/sys/audit/file` - the endpoint we called with `vault audit enable` above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a deeper look at the remaining information available in the audit log.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note all the fields that contain `hmac-sha256:` prefixed in the values. This is because Vault handles a lot of sensitive data that should not land in any logs. Thus Vault hashes most response values before logging them. This hash **is unique to the Vault cluster and audit device** that generated it. This is important to avoid attacker trying to audit hash values on another Vault instance and compare the hashes to the ones present in a leaked audit log.\n",
