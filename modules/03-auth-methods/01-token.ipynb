    "# The Token Authentication Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The token authentication method is critical to understand with Vault, as it is the underlying authentication method powering all other authentication methods. In essence every call to Vault is either unauthenticated (meaning a user does not need to be logged-in to perform the action), or authenticated via a Vault token. Thus all other authentication methods essentially provide unauthenticated login endpoints which translate some form of credential (certificates, LDAP credentials, etc) into a Vault token.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vast majority of cases the token authentiation method should not be used directly. This is because it is very basic, and provides an authentication that is local to Vault. In professional setups, one will want to use a managed identity or any other existing identity to authenticate to Vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only case where the token authentication method is commonly used is when authentication as a superuser using a root token. Nonetheless, due to the fact that tokens are the underlying logic for all other authentication methods, it is primordial to understand how this method works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Vault\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start a Vault server. This will run Vault in the background and push the logs to `/tmp/vault.log`. If at any point in time the Vault crashes, this command will need to be used again to re-launch the Vault server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, do not worry about the configuration with which we are starting the server. This will be covered in a separate module."
