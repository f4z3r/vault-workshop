    "# Templated Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Templated policies are very useful for a wide variety of scenarios. First and foremost, they allow to keep your overall policy count much smaller, and thus make it easier to keep an overview of the configured permissions in your Vault. Another very important use case is that components should not be allowed to create policies on the fly. Unless done with absolute care, this can quickly leads to situations where components can grant themselves root access. In such scenarios templated policies are very useful.\n",

    "This is quite a critical point that should not be ignored. Having a correct path structure is the main foundation to enable proper usage of templated policies. The exact structure that you might want to use is highly dependent on how you want to cut permissions, and what the use cases will be. Moreover, it should be noted that the structure should not only consider the paths in the KV secrets engine, but of the entirety of the set of secrets engines. In this example we will only use the KV engine for simplicity, but in reality this would also include other engines such as PKI, dynamic credentials, etc.\n",

    "### Creating a Simple Templated Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of templating in policies comes in the form of globbing characters: `*` and `+`. The `*` (asterisk) means any set of path segments and can only be used at the very end of a policy path. The `+` (plus) means a single path segment and can be used anywhere in the path string of a policy. Thus for instance the following policy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "path \"kv/data/teams/cloud-operations/*\" {\n",
    "  capabilities = [ \"read\" ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "grants read access to all credentials owned by the `cloud-operations` team. On the other hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "```hcl\n",
    "path \"kv/data/teams/cloud-operations/app/portal-frontend/stage/+/api-token\" {\n",
    "  capabilities = [ \"read\" ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Grants access to the `api-token` credentials for all stages. Note that the `+` can also be used as the last element of the path to ensure only a single path segment is granted and not any path below the provided root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create three templated polices that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Grant read access to any credentials within the `backend` application of the `cloud-operation` team.\n",
    "2. Grant read access to any `test` credential within the `cloud-operation` team, regardless of the application.\n",
    "3. Grant read access to any credentials of any app called `backend` regardless of what team owns the application."
